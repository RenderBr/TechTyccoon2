This is a rewrite and complete re-do of a [much older project](https://github.com/RenderBr/TechTycoon) of mine, before I really knew what I was doing in .NET and C#. It has beem built from the ground up, acting as a standard C# Console App with (obviously) added implementation. 

### Tech Tycoon... what is it?
As of right now, Tech Tycoon is in it's extremely early stages of development. It is not very feature-rich, and also not **finished- whatsoever.** It is currently just a base of a project, with a built in and easy to use command handler, and a VERY basic ability to simulate companies over timespans.

### How could I contribute?
A super easy contribution, if you're ever bored is by helping me add new features, improving the simulation experience, improving already-existing features, or arguably **the easiest** form of a contribution:
- Adding more CompanyTypes
<br> **OR**
- Adding more commands

Both of these things can be done pretty easily, and the process of implementing them are super, duper easy and almost made for other people to utilize. So feel free! Make a fork, turn it into your own project, do whatever!

### Plans? Why are you making this...
Overall, I do not have very many long-term plans for this. As of right now it is a occasional hobby project that I am actually finding really fun to work on. It is one of the first few projects I've made (recently) that is it's own project created from **essentially** scratch. I am still working on my dev skills and wanted to work on a project of my own to improve my craft, and that is exactly what I am doing here.
 For those who know me as Average, this is a very unorthodox project for me to be working on since on here I am mostly known and seen for posting TShock plugins, and this is **NOT** one of those! 
 
 So, fork/clone/download a release (when ready) and check it out! Feel free to fuck with it as much as you want, LOL.
